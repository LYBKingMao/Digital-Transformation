# Digital-Transformation
## Introduction
This is a team work of level 4's assignment:
1. In first stage, team members collected background informations about marketing, feasibility and difficulty.
2. In second stage, team members design a IoT system according to Computer Science Building of our school, defined which should contains in system, use what programming language and how to set development environment, worked out a draft timeline to build this system.
3. In final stage, we successfully build a prototype of IoT system with provided information and attended a presentation pitch at the end of the semaster.

## Challenges
1. First time experience a full stage of system implementation: from backgroun information gathering, system design, system implementation and final deliverable.
2. Fast learning and implementation: NodeJs is totally new programming language for team members, time period is also very short, team members need learn new programming language and implement system simultaniously.

## Platform
[NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
[ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
[EJS](https://ejs.co/)

## Intallation and execution
1. Download source code and install all package dependencies of project
2. Running code on command line
3. Open websites running on local host
4. Enjoy

## Features
1. 3D view of target building and point-to-point navigation (with help of [ESmap](https://www.esmap.cn/]
2. Login page connected to database, validate credentials by querying
3. Authorization control: Access all functionalities need log in
4. Keep login session
5. Using template to show hellow message to users who logged in
